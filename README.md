## ‚ú® Features

### Smart Page Detection
- **Auto-detection** - Automatically detects which Telescope page you're viewing
- **13 supported pages** - Requests, HTTP Client, Jobs, Commands, Cache, Queries, Events, Gates, Logs, Models, Redis, Views, and Exceptions
- **Page-specific filters** - Each page shows only relevant filters for that data type

### Advanced Filtering
- **HTTP method filtering** - Filter by method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) on Requests & HTTP Client pages
- **Status code filtering** - Filter by response status codes with partial matching
- **Duration filtering** - Set minimum duration threshold in milliseconds
  - **+1sec quick button** - Increment duration by 1000ms with a single click
- **Text search filtering** - Search by path, URI, query, command name, message, and more
- **Specialized filters** - Exit codes, cache actions, log levels, model actions, exception types, and more

### Smart Auto-Refresh
- **Continuous filtering** - Filters apply automatically to newly loaded entries every 500ms
- **No re-apply needed** - Once filters are applied, they work on dynamic content

### Bulk Loading
- **Load More button** - Automatically clicks "Load Older Entries" 100 times
- **Smart conflict prevention** - Automatically disables Telescope's auto-load to prevent conflicts
- **Configurable delay** - 300ms delay between each click for stability

### User Experience
- **Dark theme** - Matches Telescope's UI perfectly
- **Enter key support** - Press Enter any input field to apply filters
- **Reset button** - Clear all filters and stop auto-refresh with one click
- **Minimal UI** - Fixed position panel that doesn't interfere with Telescope

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Bookmarklet (Recommended)

1. **Get the bookmarklet code**:
   - Open `dist/bookmarklet.txt` from this repository

2. **Create a new bookmark**:
   - **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+O` (or `Cmd+Shift+O` on Mac) to open Bookmark Manager
   - **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on Mac) to show Bookmarks Toolbar
   - **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Shift+B` to show Favorites Bar

3. **Add the bookmarklet**:
   - Right-click on the bookmarks bar ‚Üí "Add page" or "New bookmark"
   - **Name**: `Telescope Filter` (or any name you prefer)
   - **URL**: Paste the entire content from `bookmarklet.txt`

4. **Done!** Visit any Laravel Telescope page and click the bookmark

### Option 2: Build from Source

If you want to modify the code or contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Antons-S/telescope-filter.git
cd telescope-filter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the bookmarklet
npm run build

# The output will be in dist/bookmarklet.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to your Laravel Telescope page (e.g., `/telescope/requests`)
2. Click the bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar
3. The filter panel will appear in the top-right corner
4. Set your desired filters
5. Click **Apply** to activate filtering

### Filter Examples

#### Find Slow Requests
1. Go to Requests tab
2. Enter `1000` in Duration field (or click +1sec button)
3. Click Apply
4. All requests taking less than 1 second will be hidden

#### Find Failed HTTP Calls
1. Go to HTTP tab
2. Enter `5` in Status field (matches 500, 502, 503, etc.)
3. Click Apply

#### Find Specific Jobs
1. Go to Jobs tab
2. Enter job class name (e.g., `SendEmail`)
3. Enter status (e.g., `failed`)
4. Click Apply

#### Load More Entries
- Click the **Load More** button to automatically load 100 batches of older entries
- The button will disable auto-load to prevent conflicts
- Watch the console for progress updates

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter** in any input field: Apply filters
- **ESC**: Not implemented (use Close button)

### Project Structure

```
telescope-filter/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ telescope-filter.js    # Source code (readable, commented)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bookmarklet.txt         # Ready-to-use bookmarklet
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bookmarklet.js          # Minified JS (for debugging)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.js                    # Build script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json                # Dependencies and scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Build the bookmarklet
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run watch

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### Build Process

The build script (`build.js`) performs the following steps:

1. Reads `src/telescope-filter.js`
2. Minifies using Terser with aggressive optimization
3. URL-encodes the minified code
4. Prepends `javascript:` prefix
5. Outputs to `dist/bookmarklet.txt` and `dist/bookmarklet.js`

### Modifying the Code

1. Edit `src/telescope-filter.js`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Copy the new bookmarklet from `dist/bookmarklet.txt`
4. Update your browser bookmark with the new code

### Code Style

- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, const/let, template literals)
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep the IIFE structure for encapsulation
- Use meaningful variable names (the minifier will shorten them)

## ü§ù Contributing

- Laravel Telescope version
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable

## üìù Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Injection**: The bookmarklet injects a dialog into the Telescope page DOM
2. **Tab Detection**: Monitors `window.location.pathname` to auto-switch tabs
3. **Filtering**: Uses DOM queries to find and show/hide table rows based on filters
4. **Auto-Refresh**: Sets up a 500ms interval that re-applies filters to handle dynamic content
5. **State Management**: Uses closure variables to maintain filter state

### Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium (v90+)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (v88+)
- ‚úÖ Edge (v90+)
- ‚úÖ Safari (v14+)

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient DOM queries**: Uses optimized selectors
- **Debouncing**: Filters only apply when clicking Apply, not while typing
- **Smart intervals**: Auto-refresh runs efficiently every 500ms
- **Memory management**: Cleans up intervals when closing dialog
